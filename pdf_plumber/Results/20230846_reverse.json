Security forces,\nincluding the IRGC and the Basij militia were deployed to violently crack\ndown on these protests. Since March 2023, the IRGC and Basij militia\nhave also been instructed to enforce the mandatory hijab law by new\nmethods of oppression.\nAlibabaei revealed a new scheme to deploy members of the Basij militia\nin each Qom neighbourhood to enforce the hijab law. The new scheme\nincludes installing programs such as “Be a famous leader in our\nneighbourhood”, ordering IRGC/Basij forces to conduct neighbourhood\npatrols, the use of intelligence, intimidation, and enforcing accountability\nof regular citizens (for example by appealing to the responsibility of\nbuilding and residence managers for “badly veiled” residents). This\nscheme represents a new level of denunciation and information gathering\nby the general population to oppress women.\nUnder the command of Alibabaei, the local IRGC and Basij forces in Qom\nare ordered to enforce certain selected laws, by means and methods that\nintimidate citizens and violate their fundamental rights.\nAs provincial deputy of the IRGC in Qom, Major Mehdi Alibabaei is\nresponsible for the acts of oppression committed by the local IRGC and\nBasij forces and their violations of the rights of freedom of expression and\nprivacy.\nHe is therefore responsible for serious human rights violations in Iran.",
